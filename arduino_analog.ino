// Original idea by Milan Karakaš, https://wildlab.org (C)2016
// Made wild idea to use analog echo reading - NOT echo pin
// from HC-SR04 ultrasonic module, just solder one wire at
// collector of the transistor as is shown on my website:
// https://wildlab.org/index.php/arduino-ulstrasonic-radar/
// This sketch "burn" onto your favorite Arduino (uno, nano....)
// and enjoy in experimenting with ultrasound "Sonograms". :o)
// Pay attention to Serial.begin(115200) because there are lot
// of data sending in short period, so both: Arduino board and
// Processing program on your computer can communicate without
// los of data. Processing you can find here: https://processing.org/
// Bonus notice: Anyone who first make this Radar, please contact
// me in the comment section below this page:
// https://wildlab.org/index.php/arduino-ulstrasonic-radar/
// And your work will be published as "Showcase" for other people 
// as an example. Later I will figure out how to reward you. Thanks.
